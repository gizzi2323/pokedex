# pokedex

Basic pokedex. 

Hosted using Amazon Web Services. Application architecture: 
Created custom VPC for security, set up EC2 instance for web server,
created RDS database and populated with information from the pokeapi,
set up CloudFront, Route53, and SSL certificates using ACM. 

Here you can find the files that I used for the actual web application part.
